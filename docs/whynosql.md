**Reason why SQL is not the most fitting choice for DApp

***Centralisation
Conventional relational databases are inherently centralised, which contradicts the fundamental principles of decentralised applications.

***Trustworthiness
Blockchain technology, such as Ethereum, offers a reliable data storage solution as the information on the chain is both public and immutable. In contrast, the integrity and security of data within relational databases cannot be guaranteed to the same extent.

***Compatibility
Smart contracts typically rely on data storage provided by blockchain networks. Consequently, if you wish to access or modify data within smart contracts, it is more appropriate to utilise the storage solutions provided by the blockchain, rather than SQL.

Having said that, SQL and relational databases remain highly effective for data storage in centralised applications or decentralised applications with centralised components. Nonetheless, for purely decentralised applications, blockchain technology presents a more suitable data storage alternative.
