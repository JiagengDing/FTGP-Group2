## Security vulnerability analysis and solutions

1. **Integer Overflow**: In the process of calculations involving addition, subtraction, and multiplication, integer overflow may occur. To solve this problem, you can use the SafeMath library to perform secure mathematical operations.
    * Solution: Introduce the SafeMath library from OpenZeppelin and use it wherever integer operations are involved.
    * import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
...
using SafeMath for uint;

1. **Random Number Generation**: The getPrice() function uses keccak256 to generate random numbers, which is unsafe. Miners may manipulate block.timestamp to manipulate the result. 
    * Solution: Use an off-chain data source (oracle) to obtain prices, such as Chainlink.
        
1. **Contract Locking**: The lockContract() function allows buyers and sellers to lock the contract multiple times. This may cause unnecessary confusion and potential attacks.

    * Solution: Add a state variable (such as bool public locked) to ensure that locking can only occur when the contract is not locked. Set it to true after successful locking.
    
1. **Event Parameters**: Some event parameters may contain sensitive information. You may need to consider limiting the visibility of this information.
    * Solution: Evaluate the sensitivity of event parameters and consider setting certain parameters as indexed to limit visibility in the log.
    
1. **Code Readability**: In some cases, the code may become long and difficult to read. To improve readability, consider abstracting certain code segments into separate functions.
    * Solution: Abstract the code segments that calculate the new position size and trigger additional margin into separate functions.
    
1. **Access Control**: To improve security, you can add onlyBuyer and onlySeller modifiers to restrict access to certain functions.

    * Solution: Create the onlyBuyer and onlySeller modifiers and apply them to the corresponding functions.
